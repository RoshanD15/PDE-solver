Numerical Simulation of Heat Diffusion and Wave Propagation

This project implements numerical solvers for the heat (diffusion) and wave equations in 2D and 3D using finite difference methods. It explores applications such as heat conduction in coaxial cables, material doping, and wave focusing with reflectors, combining algorithm design, numerical analysis, and visualization.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Custom PDE Solver Functions

wave2d: simulates 2D wave propagation with argument checking, initialization, and iteration.
